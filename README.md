# Deep Learning for Embryo Classification in IVF

This project was developed for the **World Championship 2023 - Embryo Classification Challenge** on Kaggle as part of the EEE406 - Fundamentals of Biomedical Signal Processing course.

## Objective
To automate the assessment of embryo viability using deep learning techniques, minimizing subjectivity and improving efficiency in IVF procedures.

## Dataset
- ~1,000 high-resolution Day 3 & Day 5 embryo images
- Binary labels: `Good` vs `Not Good`
- 80/20 stratified train-validation split
- Public test set for Kaggle leaderboard scoring

##  Models Used (Transfer Learning)
- MobileNetV3Large
- EfficientNetB0
- DenseNet121 ( Best model with 81% val. accuracy and 0.73333 public score)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Ablation studies (augmentation, fine-tuning, regularization)

## Kaggle Competition Result
- Public score: **0.73333**
- Estimated rank: **15th globally**
- Note: Due to late submission, team `"kadirdaglar"` did not appear on the official leaderboard, but result was valid and acknowledged in academic context.

## Team Members
- Suat Deniz   
- Abdulkadir Dağlar  
- Berkay Caplık 

## Future Work
- Grad-CAM visualizations for clinical interpretability
- Larger dataset collection
- Multi-class classification aligned with clinical grading
- Ensemble model for performance boost
